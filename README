This is a repository contains the code for Team Retriever's Software Engineering
645 semester project.

This application presents an interface for users to interact with a machine learning model. The model is 
trained on data taken from ChEMBL, a datbase of bioactive molecules with drug-like properties. Users can
enter a compound in SMILES notation to be passed to the model. The model makes estimates certain chemical
properties of said compound and displays them to the user.

In addition, users can create accounts using their email. Creating an account allows users to view a history of
past compound lookups. User account credentials are stored in a MySQL database while lookup history is stored via MongoDB.
